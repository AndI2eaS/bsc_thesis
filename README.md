BSc Thesis
==========

This is a fully working e-health application that was made as part of my last year thesis diploma during my studies at the university. It enables patients suffering from metabolic syndrome to be monitored from home and receive feedback from the doctors instantly. The application allows doctors to see a patient's measurements in form of diagrams, conduct a feedback report or maybe send a private message through the application and patients can download the feedback entered by the doctor at or just read it online in a .pdf file format.
